# Bubble Shooter

The program detects the mouse click and shoots a bubble with constant velocity in that direction.
The direction is calculated by the normalized subtraction of the launch point and the mouse position.
There can only be one bubble on the screen, and each thrown bubble gets a randomly generated color.
