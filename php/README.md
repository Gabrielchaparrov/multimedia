# Building basic web applications using PHP

The objective of this practice is to conclude the development of the Website (online store) started in practice 1, implementing the dynamic part corresponding to the maintenance section of the Webpage, which is found under the "Administrator" option of the menu, using PHP.

The objective of this practice is to use PHP to develop the necessary elements that allow access to the system for its administration, and must allow the necessary operations to be carried out:

- Allow only administrator users access to this section of the program.

- Carry out the maintenance of existing users in the application, allowing users to be modified and deleted.

- Maintain existing products in the application, allowing you to register, modify and delete products.

- Allow listing the orders made by registered users, allowing the search of orders by:

	- Registered user.
	- Product.
	- Order date.

- Allow orders made by registered users to be marked as sent, and orders must be searched using the same fields as in the lists (previous point).
