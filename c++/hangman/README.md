# Hangman
This program simulates the game of hangman. As the user makes attempts to guess the letters of the secret word, the drawing of the hangman is completed each time an attempt is unsuccessful

When executed, the user is presented with a menu with different options:

- **Show statistics** <br> By selecting this option, the program reads the information stored in the file named **statistics.txt** and displays the number of games played and won on the screen

- **Replay with the last used word** <br> If this option is selected, a game will start with the word used in the previous game

- **Play a new game** <br> When a new game is started, a random word is read and selected from the file named **words.txt** and a new game starts

- **Exit** <br> The .exe closes
