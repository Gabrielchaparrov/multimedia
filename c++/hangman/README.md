# Hangman
This program simulates the game of hangman. As the user makes attempts to guess the letters of the secret word, the drawing of the hangman is completed each time an attempt is unsuccessful

When executed, the user is presented with a menu with different options:

- Show Stats
By selecting this option, the program reads the information stored in the file called **statistics.txt** and displays the number of games played and won on the screen

- Repeat the last game
If this option is selected, a game will start with the same word used in the previous game

- Play a new game
When a new game is started, a random word is read and selected from the file called **words.txt** and a game is started with that word

- Exit the program
The .exe closes

> **Fun fact** This program was the first "big project" I ever did, I was 17 years old when I did it!
